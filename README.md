# Javascript-Calculator

I built this JavaScript calculator ([LIVE SITE HERE](https://codepen.io/justinmemphis/full/RwozmXd)) for a freeCodeCamp project.  This was one of my first full JavaScript projects.

## How It's Made:
JavaScript using the React framework

## Optimizations:
Built very simply.  It would be good to clean up the code sometime.

## Lessons Learned:
I learned a lot about JavaScript functions building this program.

## Future Changes:
Need to change the colors and add more styling.  Could also extend the functions and options with the calculator.
